I've applied my own hope and own bias to my marriage - hope that if I just do more I will receive love, support, attention, affection in the way I need it and want it. I was biased to believe what I ultimately wanted out of a relationship is also what gil wanted out of a relationship. \n\nThe last fight and subsequent reflection afterwards has illuminated this wishful thinking and hopeful disposition that has continued to overshadow my relationship. I have tried to voice my needs and learn how to do so better and better in case eventually gil got it. But her actual words, actions, and response suggests, even if she gets it she's not doing it. \n\nThis has had two big consequences. The first is that I'm never satisfied in the relationship. I am always looking to get my needs met but have learned I can't get them met in the relationship. My own duty has kept me faithful until this was challenged and I was working closely with someone who met my needs effortlessly and I met hers. That instant deep and meaningful connection led to me compromising on my boundaries and my values leading up to infidelity, physically and emotionally. Instead of ending my marriage I ended the relationship thinking that there was no path forward without pain by ending my marriage while still having parental responsibility and the loss of access to my kids if I stayed in Wisconsin (because gil needed to move back to her family in California and was eventually going to do so). This was the first biggest issue. In attempting to rebuild my relationship I initiated a trip around the world for 8 months with my wife and kids. On this time there has been no place to hide in patterns, work, or other relationships. I've learned to speak more clearly and courageously about what's actually bothering me. What my actual needs are. And when I'm not getting them met. And I've seen more clearly how there is a repeated pattern of not meeting me there.\n\nThe second consequence has been that I'm never felt truly fulfilled because my needs have never been fully met in the relationship. Because of this I have let myself wonder what it would be like to be with another woman who shows she might be able to meet my needs. Thought about what it's like to meet a woman who is interested in me and looks me in the eye and wants to see me and wants to know me. This has manifested in pornographic usage, albeit very minor. It's manifested in being flirty or engaged with others. At parties I've enjoyed meeting and engaging with people even when it means I've left gil alone. All of this she senses and I'm sure makes her feel even less sefure in our relationship. \n\nI've been unable to end our relationship, even when another woman who wanted me to and who met my needs better because it violates my commitment to my marriage and would be harmful and hurtful to my kids. My parents wouldn't support it. And i would feel like I failed my wife, failed my kids, failed my parents and failed as a person. I can't imagine life on the other side of that decision without feeling tremendous pain. So I've tried my hardest to make due, to be the glue, to end seeping fulfilling relationships, end deeply meaningful work, leave my dearest friends. I've been willing to do all of this in the hopes she shows interest in me, tries to get to know me, cares about my needs, and makes our relationship the most important priority.
