Instead of taking responsibility and ownership. I would look for gil to tell me I'm good. And when she didn't, I would feel worrhless.

The work needs to fill a spiritual cup but also a financial and power cup as well. It needed to be meaningful for the world. And I needed to have power. And make money. \n\n- now I am doing work they I feel is important spiritually. I have shared power. But I'm not making any money. However I don't share this work with Gil because at the end of the day Gil doesn't see work as a place to gain self worth. She shes work as a means to an end. Gil really feels that the connections between humans is where worth comes from and the degree to which work gets in the way of that is the degree to which she doesn't like it \n\n- without work, I don't feel interesting or like there is anything to really talk about. I love to talk about ideas, especially the way the mind works, how people work, how systems work. I feel like understanding the world creates a sense of power and agency. But there is really nothing to understand \n\n- if nothing really means anything then I like to do things for fun and joy with other people. I love working together on something, side by side. Collaborating, listening, reflecting, playing, celebrating.\n\n- the things I do are so heady.

Everything comes back to wanting to help and care for others. \n\n- what if I focused on helping and caring for Gil, Ben and Winston? I ran the family business, managed our budget, helped Ben learn financial MGMT? Facilitated our family strategy, What if I made family dance parties at home? What if I led our family in spiritual practices? What if I coordinated family volunteering and mission oriented trips? Instead of trying to help everyone else, what if I directed my focus and attention towards building our family community instead of directing it out? What if I saw gil as my business partner at home? The partner who ran this family with me?\n\n- why am I directing my focus out instead of back towards my family?  because I am trying to get approval? Because I have been compartmentalizing my life? Bc I have been caught in an idea that I need to get my external life setup first B4 I can get my family life setup? If I just get settled in the right job, then the right money, power, etc THEN I can turn my attention towards my family. I've been trying to get everything outside of my family setup so I can feel safe turning inwards and have instead made my family unsafe in the process. \n\n\n/////\n\n\n\n- why am I so focused on structuring my life around work? Work is something I do outside of my family. I do with other people. I don't really talk about it unless I'm venting or struggling.

Where we were partners in the work we were doing day to day but then came together for partnership around the family. I ran the family budget, helped Ben learn financial management, facilitated our family strategy made family dance parties. Arielle led family spiritual practices, we coordinated trips together for work and mission. \n\nWhat am I doing by trading one reality for another? Arielle and I have purpose driven work in common. We both see the world similarly when it comes to systems and roles and spiritual practices. We both enjoy building relationships and going out into the world. And we both share similar ways of relating and co-creating. \n\nGil and I don't share work in common if it's about starting a big company or running an organization. Gil sees work as a means to an end while I have seen work as a sense of purpose, more important than anything else. And then it gets in the way of us feeling connected because work is always in the middle. So I would need to think about work differently. Embrace work is a means to an end.
