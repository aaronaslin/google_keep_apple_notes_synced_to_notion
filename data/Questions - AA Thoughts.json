Develop our individual selves by becoming aware of and emobdying our self energy that is grounded, loving, compassionate, patient, gentle, creative, confident, clear, accepting, kind, honest, humble, true. Learn what purposes, rituals, roles, connections, and experiences, brings this out in us. \n\n2. Develop individual self-awareness for the parts of ourselves that get in the way of our grounded self. Parts like the Exiled (Abandoned, Shame-Burdened, Griefholder), Manager (Caretaker, Avoider, Taskmaster), and Firefighter (Rebel, Distractor, Self-Soother). Learn these parts, what triggers these parts, and the conditions we need to exist in so these parts lose their footing in our lives. Learn to love, accept and heal these parts of ourselves so they no longer hold control over us. \n\n3. Develop the purpose and meaning of our lives be sensing and responding to what brings out our true selves and cultivate the conditions that support living into this purpose and meaning everyday.\n\n4. Through this self growth and discovery, become a conduit of energy, love, respect and compassion for each other, our kids, our family, friends, neighbors, and the world at large. Foster this energy and love into each other to maintain it in ourselves. Foster this into guiding our children to find this in themselves. \n\nWhat are the negative consequences?\n\n1. The chance that this will compound the trauma of life, creating more burden and barriers to move through, that might not ultimately end in preventing us from discovering our grounded self, thus we lose each other and ourselves in the process, making it not worth it. \n\n2. The chance that our mariage won't survive and thus we will need to increasingly move apart and seperate our lives (divorce, live seperately, move to different places, have visitation with kids, etc.) And, that through this, we inflict trauma and pain on each other and on our children that won't be healed. \n\n3. The chance that our kids are grafted with the trauma of a painful seperation, internalize it, and suffer through it, creating more pain for the duration of their lives.\n\n3. The chance that we will miss building and experiencing a life together - the successess and victories, celebrations, milestones, and experiences that are more meaningful when shared. \n\n4. The suffering of going through this and the inevitable pain. \n\nWhat are the positive consequences?\n\n1. The chance to live our best life from a place of grounded self energy, not beholden to the protective parts of ourselves that hold us back and hurt us.\n\n2. The potential to relate to each other from a place of grounded self energy, not our protective parts, changing our relational field, interactions, and lived experience. \n\n3. The chance that our relationship becomes what most enables and supports our true selves and our children's true selves. That through our true self we can co-create a new relationship, purpose, rhythm, rituals container for life that fits who we are and what we need. \n\n4. An improved relationship with our children, being able to accept and love them without our protective parts getting in the way. Thus, changing the relationship field with our kids, strengthening the relationship, a more enjoyable relationship, and a much better more capable future for them.\n\n5. An improved relationship and broader support system from current and new friends, colleagues, neighbors and family. One that builds our connections outside of ourselves, our sense of community, safety and joy. \n\n6.
