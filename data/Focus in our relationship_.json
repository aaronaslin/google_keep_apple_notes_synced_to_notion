Had changed because I still was craving validation from everyone around me. I was craving validation from my work. Was Kevin validation from Friends. I was craving validation from school. And I was craving validation from you. But the validation craving is a focus on me. Not a focus on you. \n\nAnd as I reflect on where I'm at today, I realize the trauma and dysfunction is coming from where my focus has been versus where it's been.
