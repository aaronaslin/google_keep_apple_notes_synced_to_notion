# Module 3 Notes  
  
Three domains of agents   
1. Automation & Augmentation  
2. Intelligent Recommendations  
3. Facilitating Decision Making  
  
Practical Implications & Examples  
1. Increase efficiency through automating routine tasks   
2. Enhance accuracy by consistently applying predefined rules and learning from data  
3. Improve Responsiveness  
  
Safety & Ethics   
1. Human-in-the-loop prevents scaled downside risk   
2. Mitigation Strategies  
    1. Define clear objectives or goals aligned with organizational values   
    2. Monitor performance with a human  
    3. Implement access controls by restricting capabilities or agents  
    4. Provide transparency by understanding AI agent decision processes  
  
Issues with AI Integration into a company  
1. legacy architecture  
    1. Adding AI features to a piece of legacy architecture requires modifying the application which risks breaking it or its functions  
2. Data compatibility  
    1. Data is labeled differently in different databases  
    2. Data is spread out across many different databases  
3. Performance  
    1. Hardware performance is neeeded or migration to cloudbased solutions  
    2. Needsa re processing power and storage capability  
    3. Impacts of not having performance correct are high latency (lag), strained infrastructure that slows performance  
  
Approach to integrating generative and agentic AI   
  
1. System Audit  
    1. critical legacy applciations, databases, data-flow processes looking for compatibility issues, technical constraints, data flow rqrmts  
        1. Gives you a view for what benefits the most from AI driven improvement  
2. Develop Middleware and API support  
3. Data Governance   
    1. Data integrity  
    2. Data security  
    3. Reliability: protecting from loss or corruption - implementing encrpytion and secure access controls  
4. Performance Planning & Infrastructure Building  
  
  
Methods of Fine-Tuning  
1. Supervised fine-tuning  
2. Instruction-tuning  
3. RLHF - up or down vote responses  
4. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)  
5. Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
