# AI Company  
  
  
The logic of chain-of-thought processing: chain together discrete steps that iterate on each other to build a final product.   
  
The ability to conceptualize this currently is at a task level and perhaps at a workflow level. However, a company creating a product is really just a string of chain-of-thought tasks executed together, sometimes in sequence, sometimes in parallel, and often with many iterative feedback loops. As AI tools develop it’s conceptually easy to foresee a time when each task is carried out by agents inside a fully AI organization. To get there one must either incrementally build replacements for existing tasks and workflows that culminate in a full replacement of human labor or, start from the desired outcome and build the company from scratch utilizing AI tools and agents.
