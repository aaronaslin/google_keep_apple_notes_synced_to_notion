# AgenticAI   
  
  
Agentic AI is reshaping not only how work is done, but who or what performs it, requiring deliberate redesign of organizations  
  
Solution: We help you redesign your organisations for successful Agentic AI adoption.  
  
Problem: Agentic AI pilots often succeed technically, but value collapses at scale  
- Why organizations don’t change  
- Most organisations are attempting to “plug in” AI to legacy structures.  
- organisational architecture does not support autonomous, decision-capable systems.  
  
  
  
Hello Saul,  
  
This is exciting! You are out in front seeing where the puck is heading regarding AI. You understand the systemic transformation this type of change will require. You have a full career in organizational transformation to bring to bear. And now this approach will be a driver of growth for your org as companies begin adopting agentic AI. I especially appreciate  how you remain diligent on the human aspects of the transformation in your approach and your proposed solutions.   
  
As I read through this I am applying my career as a marketer (who wants to see you succeed) and my experience as an innovation leader in a company (who would be hiring you to support my team). I am focusing most on the upfront points 1 and 2. I will need more time to think through the sections. They make sense and are familiar to the OD transformation work I’ve seen. I am excited to see how they come together around agentic use cases specifically.   
  
Below are my high level thoughts on the upfront portion:   
  
- Who do you really want to hire you?   
    - I read your primary target as organizations who are currently adopting agentic AI but not seeing results scale. The pain point for this customer is a failed deployment or a lack of real results. This would keep you in a defensive position to triage what is going wrong and fix mistakes.   
    - Have you considered targeting companies that are preparing to adopt agentic AI and are aware org-change is needed? Their pain point is needing SMEs to bridge the gap between the OD and the AI world. This would give you the offensive position to work with leadership on a deployment.   
    - My gut says the latter is going to be substantially larger of a market, have a higher rate of success when they do deploy, and be more budget friendly, looking at this as a long term capability building role.   
    - I bring this up first because clarity on the orgs you’re going after changes everything afterwards and the marketer in me wasn’t totally clear.   
  
- Right now the problem statement focuses on AI scale as the goal. I don’t think this is correct. Instead I think Andrew Ng does a great job in framing how AI creates value: it can be used to reduce cost (which will be limited long term because costs reach a minimal value). Or, it can be used to unlock new growth (which is unlimited because new value can always be created).   
    - The benefit (cost reduction or significant growth potential), now clearly has a problem: they must change to get these benefits realized, and you know how they need to change.   
    - Framing the problem statement this way strengthens the impact of the offer.   
- Second, the problem statement can be strengthened by increasing the urgency.   
    - I think you could use the historic parallel to signal that those companies that didn’t learn how to work with electricity were replaced by those that did. In the same vein, there is real urgency for adopting agentic. Those companies that do so successfully will have a meaningful competitive edge over those that don’t. This feels like the a powerful appeal that is missing from the current draft.   
- Your outline goes here: i.e. Phase 1 bullet 1. so you are already preparing for it!   
  
- Adding in simple case studies or example cases will strengthen the overall proposition by making it real and tangible and also more credible. I fully appreciate that the AI community isn’t there yet and hopefully there will be some that come up in the MIT class that can be lifted into your brief.
