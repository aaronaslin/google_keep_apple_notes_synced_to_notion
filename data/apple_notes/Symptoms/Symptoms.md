This is about resentment that has been buried since your life went left but you thought it was going to go right. I am the object of your resentment. The resentment is like a lens that you’ve worn for so long you forget it is there. It has become your normal.   
  
Your resentment is triggered by a feeling of powerlessness. Because, that is what you’re resentful for - the feeling of powerlessness of becoming a mother before you chose this yourself.   
  
Now, every action is filtered through your resentment sense and those that feel like they take away your power are magnified, triggering, and hurt deeper.   
  
An argument breaks out and you can’t explain why you’re angry, sad, overwhelmed. You try to explain it but it’s not actually about the argument. It’s about the feeling of resentment.   
  
As long as the resentment is there, the filter will be there too. Nothing I can do, no effort I can make, no action I can take will be viewed purely as intended. Every action will be viewed through the lens of resentment.   
  
This wedge has driven us nearly apart. But being apart created an opportunity for agency to be found. Agency, power, is the antidote to resentment. Feeling agency softened the feeling of resentment. And when the feeling softened the attraction returned. The connection was strengthened. And memories of what it felt like before resentment came back in your body.   
  
It was clear we weren’t broken. This wasn’t broken.   
  
But, we never got clear on why it fell apart, until now. Resentment.   
  
How do you get over resentment?   
  
1. Feel it fully. Is resentment it? Is this feeling the lens? The trigger?  
2. Own it. If this is truly it, declare it. Accept the resentment is an act of compassion, of protection for your own wellbeing.   
3. Release it. What was once something to protect your heart is no longer helping. It’s now hurting. Throw it off. Commit to letting it go.   
  
This is something we need to work through.
