Choices that are and will continue to impact the lives of Gil, Ben, Winston. The truth that the part of me that chose to take Gil out on her birthday was the lonely part, the insecure part, the caretaking part. The part of me that chose to not get married when we learned of Ben was the clear part, because I knew then clearly, in that moment, that Ben deserved abundant and radiant love in his life, that another couple grounded in their love would be better suited to give. The part of me that stood at the mailbox in Fullerton and knew I was making a profound choice that would shape the world in a way that felt dissonant, not harmony, was the caretaker, pleaser and hero. That by showing up and committing I would be Gil's hero and adored with praise and affection. That I was caretaking for Ben, thinking I was solving the pain of not having a dad present every day. That I was the pleaser of my parents, making the choice that they felt wasn't a choice but a duty that I earned once another life was in play, not discussing what that meant and what alternatives there were. I knew then that this was a path of dissonance. And yet I chose it anyways, not having the courage to listen to myself. Committing to learn this most important lesson over the next 14 years - the lesson of learning to listen to the energy of the universe, even when the voices of reason, of wise council - family, of friends - say otherwise. Learning the lesson every day. Learning the lesson through the manifestation of shame, guilt, cowardice. Feeling these emotions bend and shape how I showed up with Gil. Pushing her to be what I could not. Feeling no empathy or sympathy when she was feeling the same, because I made the choice to push this aside and \"make it work\" so why couldn't she. Feeling very little connection to Ben, who didn't ask for my caretaking, didn't want my chosen style of strict parenting, financial focused caretaking. Doing the opposite of the caretaking he really needed - my present and non-judging open awareness. And for 14 years I didn't and couldn't provide this. Because it was locked away behind the choice I made to ignore who I am and what I need in order to care for, be a hero for, and appease the people in my life, not myself. \n- The truth that I have always felt the energy of the universe flowing through me, felt the call to follow it, and to nurture it. This energy has always been to absorb, synthesize, distill, discern, focus and bring forth what is needed in the moment for harmony. This energy won't go away. It's what drives what, how and why I do everything I do. The truth is I have been unable to reconcile this drive and energy in my family and friend life. This energy is being brought out and nurtured, held and amplified through my partnership with Arielle.  When we work together, magic is created 100 fold over anything I would be doing alone. This includes finding my true essence, bringing it out in me, channeling it towards harmony, peace, love, abundance. Projects like IH or PPT, feeling festival, chamber, bathhouse. Channeling it into being a more abundant, loving, grounded, compassionate husband, parent, friend, partner. That this is brought out like it is, with the interaction we have together, is something I feel in all of me, my gut, my heart and my head. It feels true. It feels real. The more I experience this the more it unlocks the parts of me that I've tried to push away and compartmentalize. The more I experience my true self, the more strongly it comes through me and the more clear I am on when I haven't honored or shown up in my wholeness. \n- the truth is the more time I spend with Arielle the more time I want to spend with Arielle. The more this moves me out of my integrity and my commitment to gil. My commitment to love in sickness and health, good times and bad, for her, for me and for the family. The truth is the more I'm reminded this commitment came from the hero, caregiver, and people pleaser. Our 7 year retreat didn't do anything more than bring to the floor these feelings and the scaffolding that's been tried unsuccessfully to hold us together. I left burying the parts of me that I want to express, in favor of the parts that bring us together. Gil left believing she needed to be separated and alone to heal. But our caretaker and hero and pleaser roles are so strongly engrained that we defaulted back to them upon entering our habitual patterns. \n- the truth is I don't feel called by the same life ambition and experience as Gil. My path keeps pointing to a different fork than the one she feels called to take. And I'm scared that if we separate all of the pain I've tried to mitigate by the roles I've been inhabitting will come back and become overwhelming. Gil will hurt and I won't be able to help her as her hero. Ben will hurt and I won't be able to caretake for him in his moments of loneliness or despair. Winston will get hurt and I won't be able to explain. My mom and dad will be hurt, call me selfish, and won't be able to forgive me. And all of these happening are too much to think about, let alone experience. An experience I don't know how I could withstand. \n- the truth is I love gil in precisely the way she knows in heart. Deep abundant love, like that of a dear friend. Not the soul burning passionate love she longs for. The truth is Gil might not ever experience that in her life, but she for sure won't experience it if I deny her the possibility in our marriage. \n- the truth is I love our children and see the power of the universe moving through them. I want them to know me in my whole self. I want them to experience the love of their mom without the pain she holds on her heart. And I want them to know the love that is possible through the presence of Arielle in their lives. \n- the truth is I am once again at an inflection point. A point of clarity around the choices ahead. One path is to continue to chose the role of caregiver, of hero, and of people pleaser. The other path is to chose to follow the energy that is bursting in me, and step into a new way of relating to the world, to gil, to Ben, Winston, my family and my friends. \n- the good news is I have experienced first hand the reality of the first choice. The scary part is trusting that choosing the energy in me, is choosing the energy and love gil, Ben, Winston, my family and friends deserve.

The truth is Gil might not ever experience that in her life, but she for sure won't experience it if I deny her the possibility in our marriage.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">- the truth is I love our children and see the power of the universe moving through them. I want them to know me in my whole self. I want them to experience the love of their mom without the pain she holds on her heart. And I want them to know the love that is possible through the presence of Arielle in their lives.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">- the truth is I am once again at an inflection point. A point of clarity around the choices ahead. One path is to continue to chose the role of caregiver, of hero, and of people pleaser. The other path is to chose to follow the energy that is bursting in me, and step into a new way of relating to the world, to gil, to Ben, Winston, my family and my friends.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">- the good news is I have experienced first hand the reality of the first choice. The scary part is trusting that choosing the energy in me, is choosing the energy and love gil, Ben, Winston, my family and friends deserve. <\/span><\/p>"}
