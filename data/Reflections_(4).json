(I want to help and support too) I guess what you shared with me all of those years ago about wanting to be with someone who is also ambitious and will enhance your tendencies, not challenge or take away from them. (Yes) I understand you're not the same person that you were 15 years ago, and you've also expressed challenges you had with Jackie, who was more or less that type of partner. (I struggled with her negativity and trauma she held around her parent dying and wouldn't and couldnt meet her there). Meanwhile, what I want from a partner is someone who's ambitious and motivated but knows how to moderate their drive (I don't want to) and incorporate me into their life in a way that's meaningful for both parties (yes I want to) . I am generally not a jealous person or clingy or even need constant reassurance or to be saved. I just want to be with someone who truly appreciates me for being me and is willing to meet me where I am, even if that's not always exciting or even when I'm not being my best self. (I feel like I do but no matter what I do it doesn't feel like you feel it) \n\n/\n\nWhen I actually think about it, I don't want a life without a family. I have always wanted a family. I have also always had Big Dreams and goals. The struggle for me is when I feel like I have to trade off one for the other. It feels like an impossible choice and one I keep trying not to make, which ends in disappointment for you. Both are big parts of me.  I want to create as much joy as possible as a family AND I want to see what can be possible if I fully apply myself to my dreams. I feel like both are possible and it shouldn't have to be a trade off. The trade-off feels like I need to make the ambitious side of me smaller so it can fit into a box to do my ikigai during working hours. That's not a box I want live in. I want to be free to keep working - talking, reading, writing, sharing, when I feel inspired. I want to see what could be possible if I follow those passions and dreams and have the time support, and encouragement to do it. I want to feel the excitement with my partner. I want to explore together and dream together about what could be possible even if it's not something we do together in the actual work but it's something we do together because we're partners in life whether that's cheering me on or helping fund it or taking on a responsibility to help me have time for it. \n\nAnd, what helps me feel comfortable in this is when my partner is excited and grounded and eager and open to share their own ikigai, working on it together, and bringing in their passion. I want to feel like I'm helping my partner achieve their passions. I want to feel the chores I'm doing and the work I'm doing and the shopping I'm doing and the money I had was actually contributing to you creating your best life. Which I want to reiterate. It's not just I want somebody to serve me. I want a partnership.\n\nSomehow it feels like that gets equated with you having to be doing the same thing I'm doing, building a company, doing something ambitious, solving a problem in the world. But that's not true. I just want to to know and to feel that I'm helping and contributing to you doing what you love, whether that's taking photos or writing poetry or completing puzzles but to actually feel that what I'm doing is helping you do that.\n\n////\n\nI'm not always living in my strongest self, and sometimes, what I'm interested in is really simple and not impactful in any way, shape, or form that's valued by society. And that's OK because I don't feel the need to always be seen by the world, I just want to be seen and appreciated by the people I love even in mundane. \n\n/\n\nWhat does being seen look like to you? What does it feel like? When do you feel seen? When do you feel valued?\n\n/////\n\nI can also appreciate admiring others who are larger than life and who do burn with an intense passion that drives their life. The gripe is that the messaging consistently in so mamy aspects of life is that only those people are valued whereas the people who are also the backbone but who do it in a non sexy way are not just neglected but devalued.\n\n I'm not sure if any of that is making sense and sorry to bring it back to me when the question was what I think about what you said. Maybe I need to give it more thought so I can be more succinct and articulate \n\nI feel like I just responded with my own word vomit. I'll probably sit with it and revise what I wrote 😖\n\nI think socializing causes a bristling mostly because I do feel isolated at times and like I can't relate to people in my surroundings. So, having to share you, the person I do feel comfortable with, triggers a scarcity mentality that I think contributes to the jealousy or insecurity I feel. As I reflect on past relationships, I find that times where it felt like my partner was being too clingy were in situations where I felt a sense of belonging and so the attention from my partner felt overwhelming. \n\nI think the working plays slightly into that same scarcity mentality, but it also triggers feelings of worthlessness that I internalized as a child from my mom prioritizing work over time with me. Also, I have never really had a drive to work. The work I do choose to engage in is done excellently and to the best of my abilities, but it has never felt all consuming, and so I can't relate to that drive, which makes me feel separate. It's a misalignment of values that I struggle to find common ground in. I also feel like my lack of interest makes me less valued, and so being with someone who not only works a lot but is also very accomplished in that work leads me to feel less than. It's like a mirror to a deep insecurity.\n\n/\n\nWhat is needed to go forward?\n\n//\n\nI keep trying to wish into being what isn't, instead of accepting what is. I keep wishing Gil was enthusiastically supportive, excited and aware of what working on purpose means to me. I keep wishing Gil was more content with our family and enthusiastically supportive of what we have and what's possible. Instead, I miss seeing Gil for what she is. Deeply perceptive, thoughtful, reflective, steadfast, courageous, loyal. Deep feeling. \n\nI keep wishing Ben was into nature, outdoors, life, kindness, generosity, compassion. Instead, I miss seeing Ben for what he is - principled, strong willed, courageous, funny, witty, perceptive, deeply feeling, deeply seeing. \n\nI don't wish for Winston to be anything other than what he is beacuse he so closely compliments things I deeply value and appreciate about myself. Affectionate, considerate, caretaking, helpful, joyful, earnest, excited. \n\nAnd, I consistently feel i'm being asked to change who I am instead of accepted and loved and valued for who I am. \n\nYou can't change people. You can only change yourself. And I don't want to change myself. And I don't feel like myself is compatible \n\n","title":"Reflections ","userEditedTimestampUsec":1720056682613000,"createdTimestampUsec":1719879558777000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">What comes up for me is that in your ideal or selfish world, you would either not have a family or you would have a partner that supports you in your goals without asking for anything in return.
