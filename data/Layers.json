We've traveled across the country and the world. We have raised two kids. We have rented apartments and purchased a home. We've laughed and cried together. Gotten angry at each other. Forgiven each other. We have kissed and made love, had sex and abstained. We've longed to be with each other and we've longed for space to be alone. We have done so much together. And yet we've done so little, together, intimate and attuned to each others needs. We've seen but we haven't felt. We've seen but not understood each other's deepest desires. We've desired support and received it but not in the way we've needed it. We've barely kissed, barely looked in each other's eyes, barely spent time spending time. The many bids going empty and unnoticed resulting in tiny slights and disappointments that compound in layers of separation, slowly over time. Now, the layers have gotten so deep they shield us from each other. They shield us from expectations that go unfulfiled. They shield us from the hurt of wanting intimacy, connection and love. Yet the layers weigh on our hearts like cement. They hold us apart, instead of bring us together. So many little layers that are impossible to explain. And as we start to chip them away, we still hope that the love from each other will be enough to break through and release what's in our hearts once more. Which could be, except that we are the ones that tirgger the layers in each other and the hope for love simply adds one more.
