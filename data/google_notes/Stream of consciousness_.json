{"color":"YELLOW","isTrashed":false,"isPinned":false,"isArchived":false,"textContent":"I have always wanted to be friends. I let the physical intimacy, and co-parent intimacy, feeling the fulfillment of my partner duties and the responsibility of my parental role all lead me to believe that moving in together and then getting married together was the right way forward, what was best for you and Ben, and what I wanted in life. And yet I didn't add into the equation what I wanted and how important that was, or how that could be achieved with what we already had as friends. Instead, I tried to make what I wanted justified as necessary, because I couldn't face the shameful truth that doing what I wanted would actually mean raising Ben apart and having to exist in a split relationship for the rest of life. But all I did was bypass my actual feelings, as an overcorrection to actually speaking what I thought I wanted but watching that only create pain too. So one time I said what I thought I wanted and that pulled us apart. Then I didn't say what I thought I wanted and now it's pulling us apart. And now we are here again and I'm confronting myself on what I want. I want to be friends. I don't want to be married. I don't want a small social circle. I want to go out and meet as many people as I can and build a wide and shallow net. I don't want to compartmentalize my working self from my family self from my friend self from my husband self. I want these parts of me to feel integrated with the people in my life. I want to feel like what I want is also integrated with what the people in my life want, especially a partner or spouse. I want to build and challenge and create with people. I want to live outwardly and loudly with parties and music and celebration because its all part of the big network of people who care about love. I want to reconnect with nature but then take that grounded energy and bring it out into the world. I don't want to keep it sequestered for my closest circle. I want this to feel beautiful and attractive and desirable and connecting for the people around me, especially a partner or spouse. And I want to cook and play and ideate on what could be possible if we xyz. That's what I want. That's the person who was in the car going to six flags. That's the person who I was terrified of losing when the fear of being a father kicked in because the structures I thought were needed were not in place. That's the person I've been trying to be when we have gone out to dinner or coffee. And that's the person that is scared of coming out because I feel like the more I am this person the less close we become and the more harm it does to you and our kids - the people I'm closest to in the world and have a responsibility to nurture and protect and care for. I want this in my life and I don't believe coming together, moving in, and getting married was the wise decision for what I really want. It was the safe and responsible decision but not the one where I feel I'm being totally me. I take responsibility for how not listening to myself, not sitting with the discomfort of reality, and not being brave enough to have this conversation with you 14 years ago. I take responsibility for how much hurt this causes now and I feel in my deepest part of my heart the pain of the responsibility and the sorrow of the hurt it has, is and always will cause. Because I did my best until I knew better. Now that I know better, I need to do better. Doing better means being honest with myself - thinking about the really hard questions - and being brave and honest with you because you have always and will always deserve to be met with truth.
