But when I'm doing things that I want to do, I feel sheepish, insecure, uncomfortable, angry. I send you a message saying this is what I want and you don't reply back with any solutions about how we can make that happen together. But yet when I want to do something like take a job you support it. Like your actions are always supportive of what I want. Yet I'm for some reason not honest with you about what I want. It's like I don't trust you to tell me no. It's like I don't trust you to be honest with yourself about what you want. And it makes me feel less safe expressing what I want. Cuz what if what I want isn't actually what I want? What if it's just a hair brain idea. \n\nI want to will connected. I want to feel loved. I want to feel seen. I want to feel appreciated. I want to feel wanted. I want you to look at me when I'm working and think it's the hottest thing you've ever seen. I want you to be aggressive with me when you think you feel a certain way because you know you feel that way. I want you to tell me and tell me yes and call me out and challenge me. I want you to be the strongest person you could possibly be because then it helps me be the strongest person I can possibly be. But if I'm stronger than you and it hurts you, I try to dim my powers. I want and need you to hold my strength and hold my ability and hold my chaos and hold my experience. And so at the end of the day what I feel is true is you need someone who is going to be commanding and direct and forceful and clear until you know and tell you yes and give their focus to you so that you can feel and step into all of yourself that has been hidden behind being a caregiver, your whole life and until you have somebody who's able to do that just step in and say command only. They love you no matter what through thick and thin for the rest of life until we die and show you that every single day with every single amount of focus from the first kiss to the last kiss from the way things are created together to the way things are done separately till that is alive in you. It's going to be very hard for you to truly give me what I feel like I need and want. And that feels like truth and it feels f***** up. It feels like the root of what brings us together is trauma. I need the same thing you need. I want the same thing you want and I keep finding myself feeling like if I could get this if I can show up this way if I can be seen in my power if I could be appreciated for who I am. If I could be loved for everything I am. Jenn, I can return that love and spades because my cup will be overflowing \n\nSo what do you do with a relationship like that? \n\nI would need to say I want to be in your life no matter what and show you that through my actions everyday especially when it's hard, especially when there's challenges and emotions. I would need to believe in you and care for you through belief that you're more powerful than you even know and just keep telling you that and affirming that to you and sharing that with you and seeing you that way over and over and over again so you start to believe it in yourself.\n\nBut now I feel like I'm being a hero like if I show up that way for you, which is the way I keep showing up like oh Joe like if you saw what I saw. If you understood yourself through my eyes, you would realize how beautiful and amazing and powerful and honest and true you are. But when I say that to you, it crumples you. It makes you feel unaccepted. It makes you feel like your mess is not valid or worth it or only lovable if you show up a certain way. \n\nIt's just so messy. It's so chaotic. It's so frustrating. It's so much trauma wrapped up in so much of our relationship and there's so much love and so much care and so much seeing of the other person's weaknesses and strengths and loving them all \n\nSo why do I feel so much attraction to you when you're not here? Because it's when you're doing what you want and it's also the space to see you do that. That makes me feel safe. It's the feeling that you don't need me. Makes me feel like I can love you without expectations. And I imagine it's the same thing for you. The feeling that I don't need you makes you feel safe too, like I can finally just be myself without having to worry. \n\n","title":"Letter to Gil","userEditedTimestampUsec":1730247808326000,"createdTimestampUsec":1729959328087000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Why do I want you so f****** much when we are apart apart and then when we come together and make love feels incredible.
