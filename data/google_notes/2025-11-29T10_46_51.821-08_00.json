{"color":"DEFAULT","isTrashed":false,"isPinned":false,"isArchived":false,"textContent":"Day 91 - Last Day in Europe (Schengen)\n\nToday we spent the day near our tiny hotel room waiting to depart to Tanzania. The day marked day 87 of our 88 day time in the Schengen zone. We came into Iceland on August 26th. It feels like a lifetime ago. Since then we have explored Paris and the French Riviera. Watched super cars and super yachts in Monaco. Road tripped from the alps of northern Italy to the tip of Sicily. Swam in the Mediterranean off Crete on the north side and south side of the island. Loved Greece and discovered both Thessoloniki and Athens. Tripped to Sarande Albania. And made it all the way back to Rome, Florence, and then back to Rome. Phew! What an experience. \n\nNow marks a turning point as we head south of the equator to Tanzania before coming back north to Bangkok and Hanoi, Vietnam for Christmas and New Years! \n\nTo mark our last day in Italy we got sushi for lunch 😂 and got pasta for dinner. Winston got a burger and said it made him less home sick. As we head to bed early we eagerly await the alarm for 330 am to head off to the airport. Wish us luck!
