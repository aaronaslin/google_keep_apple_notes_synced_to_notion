Autopilot. Cohabitating. Getting along. \n\nLast night was probably one of the lowest nights for me in our relationship.  waves of buried thoughts and emotions kept crashing through my head making me feel worse and worse about our our relationship and how far it feels from what it can be. \n\nFeeling resentment because I don't feel we connect intimately, and that you don't want to or like to. I keep settling for familiar  ways of loving you instead of prioritizing  practicing your love language. Your reactions, or lack there of, trigger feelings of low esteem because I blame myself for our lack of intimacy - \"something's wrong with me and how I'm approaching our relationship\". Yet, I feel like I'm the one that's doing most of the trying in all these ways that go unnoticed or unreciprocated leaving me feeling even more resentful. I I can see that it might be possible you feel the same way.... Like you're the one trying and I'm not getting it. Is that true?) Which leaves me feeling like these feelings trigger you to feel like loving me is just an dutiful obligation, another burden in your life, not something for you to express joy, gratitude or love. When you share that you're aware of this pattern of behavior and feelings in your past but then perpetuate it by turning away with seemingly your own resentment, it feels even worse creating a cycle deepening resentment further. \n\nMy way of solving this problem is also a problem. I want to jump in and solve it open hearted, passionately, crescendoing to a reafirming physically intimate embrace and your way is to withdraw, burry, avoid in what feels like an attempt to wait it out in hopes it will go away.  I'll start talking. I don't start listening. I don't know what questions to ask. I just know how I feel. You reiterate how you feel, not how it makes me feel. There is some intimacy but deep down I feel like it's just you pretending in hopes it will placate me. Nothing is actually solved. The feelings get buried. We aren't closer. We just have thicker walls. So then I compensate by trying to show you love with favors or keeping my distance or worse, burry my feelings in distractions, mainly work. Which is what I have been doing all week. But then the feelings all comes up to the surface which is what happened last night. It was deeply overwhelming. \n\nBehaviors that contribute to resentment: \n\n- Not reciprocating\n- reciprocating in the smallest way possible\n- Not kissing. Flat out rejecting kissing and feeling like you're hiding in \n- For being able to get whatever you want (if you're turned on) but hardly, if ever, inquiring or exploring what I want/need\n- Feeling like my needs are just one more burden in your life\n- Not being able to be intimate physically \n\nI'm frustrated that to get a good sleep you have to keep leaving the room. \n\nI'm saddened that you still watch porn instead of coming to find pleasure with me. Even texting me romantic thoughts, building our own anticipation. \n\nI'm angry that the animals and the kids constantly find ways to take away our sacred time together. \n\nI'm confused that when we have time alone or away it's not intimate, romantic, connecting. Instead if feels like were stuck in bad habits. \n\nI feel disconnected at not having any intimacy or feeling of special connection with you in PE all of our communication. It feels like we are co-habiting our life.\n\nWhat did you mean when you said I would be aroused by any other woman so it has nothing to do with you? It feels cynical. Self loathing. Sad. \n\nI hear you say what you want and need is feeling connection. But the way I connect through touch goes un-noticed, unappreciated or flat out rejected. And it leaves me feeling disconnected too.\n\nI keep coming back to needing to learn your love language yet you've shown no interest or commitment to learning mine. \n\n\n\n","title":"Marriage ","userEditedTimestampUsec":1703629613722000,"createdTimestampUsec":1674017805202000,"textContentHtml":"<br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">1/19<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Marriage Book Club - we read these together and have a date a sacred time committed each week to talk about them.<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Books:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">- Love Languages (help understanding what each other's love language looks like, and doesn't)&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">- 8 Dates (asking the right questions to better understand each other and ourselves)<\/span><\/p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">- From the Core&nbsp; (understanding masculine/feminine energy)<\/span><\/p><br /><br /><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">1/17-1/18<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Awakening to the idea that our marriage is in a rough patch.
