It's about a lack of self love and self worth and self respect that was deeply part of me before we met. \n\nThis trauma is the trauma that has created the real underlying pain and harmed you, harmed Ben, and has brought our marriage to the brink. \n\nI thought it was about choosing what I wanted vs choosing you. But I was wrong. I realized that what I want is actually validation from the outside. What I need is to find it inside of me. \n\nI see now how my obsession with finding validation through my work, through other relationships, and through giving up my focus to everyone else has been at the root of dysfunction in our marriage and dysfunction for Ben. My hot and cold has been driven by chasing validation. My lack of focus on you, and your needs, Ben and his needs, Winston and his needs have all been driven by chasing validation. \n\nI understand that you have every right to say to hell with me. It's been too long. I understand why you would not have trust or confidence I can change. And I can understand that this isn't the only dynamic that hurts our relationship, but I do believe this is the root of it for me. \n\nI am committed to finding self love, self respect, value from within and be more aware and conscious of where I'm coming from when I make decisions. I am committed to priortize my needs. And I have a feeling that in doing so this is something we can work on together and can fuel us in a way it never has before. \n\nSecond, I had a major understanding of what brings us together and how to think about life through my lense with us as partners in crime, and co-equals, figuring out our course together. What left me with a pain deep in my heart was that I might have realized this too late. I see how we come together and share our focus on the life we are creating together. This is possible in a completely new way because for the first time I understand why work is not and connect be the higher priroity than you and than our family. I understand why it was - because it was my source of validation - but I also see it for what it is now. What I'm clear on is how much our family, being with you, raising our kids together, and creating a life together is and has been the most meaningful and worthwhile experience of my life. And that has been when I've been creating trauma in our relationship. I can only imagine what is possible as I get older and wiser and you do too. \n\nSo this is my complete submission of what I want. Coming from a place of pure joy, not validation. Coming from a place of love. \n\n","title":"Letter to Gil","userEditedTimestampUsec":1730247528292000,"createdTimestampUsec":1730166097235000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Gil,<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I need to focus on loving myself and building and developing self respect.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I realize my trauma really isn't as much about Ben.
