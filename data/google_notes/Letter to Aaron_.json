She is going to experience joy, longing, love, pleasure again. And it's going to come from someone else, a different man, and not you. And that man will get to experience Gil has she is without the baggage of shared trauma in the past. He will be able to hold her and see her and feel his heart race when he's with her. He will receive her love fully and give her love fully. And maybe she won't find this or experience this. And that's okay too. She will have had that already in life, from you. She will have shared the love of a wedding day. Of a honeymoon. Of a spontaneous makeout. Of feeling hot and being taken. Of being longed for. Of being loved wholly and completely. She will always have this in her life and you will be the one who gave that to her. No one can take that away from her. No one can take that away from me. \n\nI will always have the experience of kissing gil. Of feeling butterflies. Of holding hands. Of longing for a kiss. Of being loved. Of surrendering to a moment. Of making love tenderly. Of making love hard. Of feeling disappointed by it all and overwhelmed too. Of feeling the love of another human deeply in my life. That is what has been.\n\nBut it's not possible for it to be permanent. It will fade as my body fades. It will hurt as longings aren't always met. It will end when I die. And life will continue to go on. Love will happen. Hearts will connect. Love will die. Hearts will break. Humans will live out their desires in the open or in the darkness. but the longings of the heart will always be. \n\nAnd like the desire for something you can't have, it becomes a source of self loathing, of self suffering. An attachment to feeling unworthy. Of desiring worthiness from the reciprocation of the other person. And this unworthiness is at the root of the suffering. Because held as worthy, held as equal, and held in the present, there really only is the experience of being right here and right now. \n\nOf meeting the need in the moment or having the strength to deny it if it's not alive in me. To be honest with myself. And put that honesty into the world. To name the fears. To hold the space. The embrace the pain. To embrace the joy. To hold the whole world in the palm of your hand. All of the pain and all of the joy all at the same time. Overwhelming all at once. And in this moment life is happening and the energy of focus is coming to the present experience of right here and right now. \n\nFuck. Its so hard to hold it. And yet, it's the axis of power that holds everything together. The only way to truly hold it is to surrender to it. And feel it as the whole universe itself. Not separate from it but part of it. Part of the joy. Part of the pain. All the energy together.love.
