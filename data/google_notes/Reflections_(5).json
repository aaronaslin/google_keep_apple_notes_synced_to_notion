We couldn't give more than we had in us. \n\nYears of hiding from our real needs, downplaying our real wants, and deflecting or projecting onto each other has not been healthy. This isn't just in our relationship. This is in all relationships. Gil has not felt special, prioritized and a unit with me. I've not felt understood or appreciated by her. Taken together, we have been suffering, questioning if this is really what a healthy marriage is about, or if we messed up in getting married to each other, instead of focusing on building and establishing our friendship and parental roles for our children. We haven't confronted this directly ever, bc we both have experienced open accepting love for each other and the spark that is present between us when we are unburdened and at peace. We both know first hand the challenges with raising kids apart. If we can make it work, it's better for the kids and easier for us. We have felt it. Now if we can just figure out how to support each other everything works. This sounds like an unhealthy relationship that has become everything we don't want. Co-dependcy, unhealthy power dynamics, self-blaming, hurting each other, stunting our own growth...\n\nIn December I became untethered - aware that I was living in a fantasy in my head by projecting and deflecting on everyone around me. This marked a turning point for me becoming aware of how I was thinking and acting. Then, losing my job, created space to confront the role I had learned to hide behind. As long as I was anchoring my family income, I was loving our family and helping in the way I was supposed to culturally. The amount of uncertainty and emptiness that became overwhelming at this time frightened me. I felt like I didn't know how to relate to myself let alone anyone else. I felt like everything I had done had resulted in pain for those around me, and for me. I couldn't figure out which way was up. Was I crazy? Was everyone else crazy? \n\nI met Arielle during this time of transition. She showed me that the parts of me I was ashamed of or embarrassed by, the parts that failed me at WS, OV, TM, RP, JIU, were what made me unique and were part of who I am. That my orientation, approach, and ideas were helpful, critically important in a community emergent context, not wackadoodle and a threat like they had been everywhere I worked. She was not only validating but encouraging me to say these are the ways of thinking that are my super power. She was encouraging me to express what came easy and inviting me saying IH needs me, she needs me, and the people we serve need me to bring my super powers to the work and the world.  She is one of the few people I've met that has said this about my work and met me here (Athena was one, AJ was one, and Jason was one). This felt validating, affirming, loving and supportive and gave me the courage to move from becoming untethered to focus on becoming whole, a fish in water, aware of and embracing my strengths that I had pushed down for my whole career. Being seen this way, at this moment of intense vulnerability and feeling lost was a powerful feeling of being loved and accepted for who I am, not who I've tried to project to be. This brought on feelings of attraction - wow I feel seen. A desire to reciprocate and love back in the ways I am being shown love - by listening, validating, affirming. And the ways I show love - words of affirmation and physical touch like hugs. And these feelings were confusing because they are happening outside of my marriage. I love Gil and value deeply what we have together and decided to share this with her in transparency with the hope she would see my actions as good faith commitment to each other and our fidelity. I also share these feelings with Arielle and let her know I can't work together if there is an intention for more out of our relationship. She reiterated her support for gil and I and also afirmed how much she respected and appreciated the candor for the health of all of our relationships and how she wants to build bridges with Gil so she's not a threat. Gil was hurt by my sharing, both harkening back to early betrayal and feeling inadequate, exacerbating her own feelings of doubt. She courageously has supported me working with Arielle while acknowledging how hard it is to hold.\n\nThis experience jolted me into a new way of thinking, being and relating to myself. This experience has also increased my capacity to give more to Gil (sitting with the discomfort when she needs me) more than I ever have been able to in the past. This experience has also triggered Gil and I to dig in deeply into who we are as individuals, how we show up when we are unhealthy, and the support we need on the path to getting healthy. I feel increasingly healthy - able to hold what I couldn't before and return my love and support. In the last two weeks this has profoundly changed how I communicate with Gil. Now I've experienced affirming and validating communication, I am better equipped to meet Gil where she is and support her in ways she needs to be supported, but I haven't been able to. In doing so I'm opening up the questions and confusions and fears we've both buried deep and hidden from each other. We are now confronting these fears. \n\nThe number one fear is the fear of loss. Fear of losing ourselves - being rejected for not being able to meet the needs of each other. Fear of never experiencing our full self. Fear of not being good enough. Fear of never really being accepted for who we are by the person we want it from the most. Fear of losing each other - breaking up and losing the practiced love intimacy and support we bring for each other.  Fear of losing parenting cohesion for our children and instead creating more suffering. Fear of an unknown future if we separate and all of the hardship it entails. \n\nThe path forward is to confront these fears head on - leaning into the discomfort while witnessing, validating, and accepting each other as enough. Only then can our marriage be based on loving each other wholly, and not on who we wish each other could be (or we could be for each other).\n\n","title":"Reflections ","userEditedTimestampUsec":1709129100440000,"createdTimestampUsec":1709116739983000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">We are making great progress as a couple.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">The pressures and challenges of our relationship often times left us needing support from each other that we were not able to give to ourselves, or each other.
