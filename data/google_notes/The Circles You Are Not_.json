As long as their is a choice being made, their is attachment and ego behind it. Being isn't a choice. Fish don't chose to swim nor birds choose to fly. Being present is to freely be the circle of the moment while just as freely let the circle die/go/erase, in the next moment.\n\nEmptiness isn't the end state, emptiness is the path, tool, state that opens or unlocks all the doors around you. In emptiness you are free to notice without interpretation. How you react is the circle you inhabit. \n\nThere is no world where you are removed from action.

In his choice to turn inward, seeking a state of abiding, he missed an opportunity for radiating that abiding to those around him, making himself and the world more full of love. \n\nI am not a pet owner. When my pet dies my identity of a pet owner doesn't die too. The pet activities cease to exist. But when my pet needs food, I feed it. When it needs exercise, I walk it. However, I am a parent. When my child dies so too does my label as parent. \n\nYou're given a gift you don't like. If the person who gives you the gift gets upset they weren't giving the gift for you, they were giving the gift for them. \n\nThe husband who acts like a husband, and does all the husbandly things, is playing a role \"wearing a mask\" and pretending. This is ego and this separates the husband from the actual reality via cognitive distortions and biases that ensure his role is protected. But the good husband understands the role IS to be present to the needs of his wife and act on those needs when the moment invites it. And to do this you must be present in abiding. \n\n\nI have been incredibly good at inventing and creating stories in my head about the people around me, the world around me, the way things should be instead of the way they are. When this view is challenged I've felt slighted, I've deflected, I've discounted, twisted, ignored, or even attacked the person bringing the idea. And I've believed that this world view around me is real. I'm articulate because I'm a really good story teller.... And yet I've always wondered how people create such elaborate stories and fantasies believing that fiction is fiction and non-fiction is fact. But I've realized the stories Ive been telling myself are as fictional as a fantasy story when I thought they were the truth. Whoa. \n\nSince realizing this I've realized how much I've used my charisma to spin a story a room an experience into what reality is. I've been bad at actually hearing and listening and understanding what the perceived reality is, the needs are, and the wants are of those around me. I've thought arrogantly how if they only got what was in my head everything would be better. And better yet, they'd realize I was right. \n\nSince realizing this, ive had a desire for quietness. Open to see the world for what it is.  I feel like I need to learn a new language. I need to learn how to ask new questions. Learn how to be present. Learn how to sit with other people and where they are at. I realize too how hard phone conversations can be ... How much they have pushed towards explaining the reality in my head and not reality. It's hard to explain reality when you don't have needs. It's not necessary to talk about reality. All there is is being together in the present moment. \n\nTalking about the past dwells on the last. Talking about the future dwells on the future. And in dwelling on the past and on the future we are opening up the stories we tell ourselves about both. The more we dwell the less we are in reality and in the present moment.  \n\nTao - Wu Wei - is the art of not forcing. Zen is about releasing attachment....\n\nRichie Davidson\n\nRESEARCH\n\nHypothesis: neautal networks underpin our perceptions. Meditation/mindfulness untether the networks allowing for perception to become open, not patterned or habitual. Or, meditation changes our neural networking by connecting different areas of the brain that cognitive thought don't connect....\n\nHabitual takes less energy. It's safe. It's comfortable. \n\nWhy do people chose the familiar when a new could make their life better? \n\nI think, therefore I am - thinking itself is the catalyst for building a neural network. Past is forging through networked ideas. The future comes from networked ideas. Open awareness exists without networked ideas... And creates new networks \n\nUsing language to name what we perceive with our senses and putting these words together in a logical sequence provides us with an understanding of cause and effect. -- This sounds like a neural network. \n\nOur ability to understand cause and effect gives birth to ideas of what we could have; which in turn leads to the concept of desire. -- the desire points us to what we perceived will help us survive, feel good. \n\nDo we desire pain? If a neural network associates pain with pleasure then yes. So if I associate the pain of cold plunges with the mindful benefits afterwards, over and over, then I will desire a cold plunge as the way to get the benefit. \n\n\n\"Once we glimpse our mind as a set of processes, rather than getting swept away by the seductions of our thoughts, we enter the path of insight\"\n\n\n\n","title":"The Circles You Are Not

This is ego and this separates the husband from the actual reality via cognitive distortions and biases that ensure his role is protected. But the good husband understands the role IS to be present to the needs of his wife and act on those needs when the moment invites it. And to do this you must be present in abiding.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><br /><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I have been incredibly good at inventing and creating stories in my head about the people around me, the world around me, the way things should be instead of the way they are. When this view is challenged I've felt slighted, I've deflected, I've discounted, twisted, ignored, or even attacked the person bringing the idea. And I've believed that this world view around me is real. I'm articulate because I'm a really good story teller.... And yet I've always wondered how people create such elaborate stories and fantasies believing that fiction is fiction and non-fiction is fact. But I've realized the stories Ive been telling myself are as fictional as a fantasy story when I thought they were the truth. Whoa.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Since realizing this I've realized how much I've used my charisma to spin a story a room an experience into what reality is. I've been bad at actually hearing and listening and understanding what the perceived reality is, the needs are, and the wants are of those around me. I've thought arrogantly how if they only got what was in my head everything would be better. And better yet, they'd realize I was right.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Since realizing this, ive had a desire for quietness. Open to see the world for what it is.&nbsp; I feel like I need to learn a new language. I need to learn how to ask new questions. Learn how to be present. Learn how to sit with other people and where they are at. I realize too how hard phone conversations can be ... How much they have pushed towards explaining the reality in my head and not reality. It's hard to explain reality when you don't have needs. It's not necessary to talk about reality. All there is is being together in the present moment.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Talking about the past dwells on the last. Talking about the future dwells on the future. And in dwelling on the past and on the future we are opening up the stories we tell ourselves about both.
