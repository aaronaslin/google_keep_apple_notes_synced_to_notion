I feel a lot of mixed emotions about it, and I want to take responsibility for my part in this dynamic. I know that what I\u2019m sharing may be difficult, and I\u2019m open to hearing your feelings as well. I just want to be honest with you and with myself, and I appreciate you hearing me out as I work through it.\n\nWhat is true is that you and I came together with our purpose of working together. We didn't come together with the intention of having a relationship, a physical relationship, an intimate relationship, or anything else. When I met you at Noble Rind I told you I had feelings of attraction for you and if and if we can't setup boundaries then we probably shouldn't work together. I also told you on our walk around your neighborhood, I needed this to be completely platonic for this to work. Both of those statements were me practicing something I'm not good at which is boundary setting. And since then both of those boundaries have not been honored. I take responsibility for letting myself open up more and more and including allowing ideas that this is something more than a work relationship to take hold. It is true that we have very strong chemistry together. It is true that what we have is sacred and special and it is also true that this would be an amazing starting place for a relationship under different circumstances. But it's not a I can accept for breaking my marriage commitment and risking disrupting my family life. That's because you are giving me something I can't have in my marriage but that's not a foundation to leave a marriage. If that was the foundation then as soon as you don't give me something I want, our relationship would be equally as vulnerable to me leaving it, and vulnerable to you leaving it. There is no relationship that creates 100% of what we want and our relationship would be vulnerable to that. Just like my relationship with gil has been vulnerable to this moment. \n\nWhat I'm learning is that what I need is different than what I want. What I need is to develop a sense of self-worth from the inside out, not from the outside in. What I need is to be able to set and hold boundaries based on principles and values that I won't compromise so that I have self-respect and manifest self-love. What I need is to stop looking for validation from other people. \n\nWhat I said I wanted was essentially external validation. I wanted meaningful work but work for me is validation and meaning. I wanted a lot of shallow relationships across many people. But what that really means is I want a bunch of people to tell me how great I am but I have no real relationship with them. What I wanted is to do parties and host. Parties is cheap validation putting on a party. People automatically tell you how great it is, but that doesn't mean those people are truly your friends. What I wanted was for me to be beautiful, attractive and desirable to the people around me, especially my spouse which is literally saying I want them to validate my self-worth. \n\nThose might be all things I want, because I haven't actually established self-respects self-worth and self-love. I haven't done the work to face into my challenges, mistakes, demons and instead have tried to hide them with people telling me how great I am. I can remember times in my life where I lost friends and instead of learning to be more of myself, I tried to be more of what they wanted, and I've continued on that path since that time. I've never really learned to just love myself for who I am. \n\nNow I need to confront the very fact that I've made decisions from a place of deficit, not from a place of self-love and self-respect. These decisions have opened myself up and created attachments and expectations and intimacy in places that they should not be allowed to grow. They've weakened my marriage. They have weakened my relationship with my business partner. They've weakened my ability to be a father. They have weekend the love of myself and my sense of self-worth. \n\nAnd I'm fully committed to not making from this place because I can see now that no matter what it will not be sustainable. \n\nSo I'm coming back to make decisions from what I need first and not from what I want. I need to develop a sense of self-love and self-respect. That means I need to honor the commitments I've made and the relationships I've built. I need to care for myself first. Be a husband and father second and then be a business partner or collaborator third. If I don't live into this I I can feel in my bones and I will struggle forever with feelings of self-respect and self-love. \n\nSo now I need to understand what this means for you and I and our partnership going forward. There's some very obvious places where things would need to change and these places are going to feel very hard. I'm not convinced our partnership needs to end, but I am certain that if we can't establish and maintain healthy boundaries it will have to end. So this is what invitation to Co-Create what is needed in our field now so that we can continue to do the work that I feel like you and I are really uniquely able to do. \n\nThis is what I feel I need right now, and I understand that it may not be easy to hear. My intention is to work through this and find a path forward. \n\n","title":"Reflections ","userEditedTimestampUsec":1730249205581000,"createdTimestampUsec":1730249205581000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I want to share something that&rsquo;s been on my mind, even though it&rsquo;s not fully clear to me yet.
