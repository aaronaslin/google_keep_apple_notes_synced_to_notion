I found her profile online, thought she was attractive and she had a real conversation with me when I talked to her. We dated for 3 months. During this time we had a great time exploring and experiencing the world. We kissed and made love a lot. But once we started talking about vision for life it became clear that we had different visions. I wanted a partner to work alongside me. She wanted a partner to explore the world with. We each wanted what the other wanted but in different priorities. We broke up because our dreams were different. Then I got her pregnant. She wasn't going to tell me until her friend convinced her she needed to tell me. She wasn't going to tell me because she didn't think I wanted to have a child. When she told me I was more scared than I had ever been in my life and I tried to take control by telling her I wanted to give it up for adoption because I believed a loving two parent household was the best for my son. She thought I was saying because she wasn't good enough to raise the baby. She told me I could leave his life and didn't need to stay. Her desire was to ensure I followed what I needed and wanted because what she needed and wanted was to raise a child. But I would never leave out of love and responsibility. I went to her prenatal appointments. I remember feeling fear and sadness not joy and happiness. She didn't call me to tell me she was in labor. She called me after he was born. That really hurt bc I wasn't there for his birth. The first time I saw my son I was incredibly sad and scared. Alone. Doing my best to pretend. I moved to be close to her. I gave her a $100 check for child support and she got upset it wasn't enough and filed for child support. We got a court ordered support amount and custody plan. She dated and then she got married and when she did I got very scared. I was losing control and access to my son. I intentionally went to school close to her to be close to my son. She moved 2 hours away and I had to visit on the weekends. I sued her to keep her from moving farther away, to Kansas, but ultimately gave up the lawsuit because it would have hurt my son and her. I got visitation for 3 weeks every 2 months. We did this for about 6 months. We stayed friendly, connecting every so often when we got together. She ended up moving back to California and we started talking again as co parents. I helped her move on a long road trip and we reconnected like we did before we broke up. Lots of physical intimacy. It felt safe because if she was with me I wouldn't be hurt. I found her very attractive. And I was lonely. I wanted to raise my son in a two parent house but wasnt finding a woman who was supportive of me having a child. I was insecure and didn't know myself. I kept trying to date other women while also trying to build a relationship with gil eventually I decided it was better to be with Gil and asked gil to move in. We got along. We were attracted to each other. And she needed help with Ben while going to school. It made sense. We got really busy with her school and my work and caretaking for Ben. Eventually I asked her to marry me. We were living together, things were going fine. She said yes. On our wedding day I remember feeling sad. I remember feeling that she felt sad to me. Not joyful. Not over the moon. Not deeply in love. And I desperately wanted this. But wasn't feeling it from her. Then on our honeymoon it didn't feel like the overly romantic smitten honeymoon I had dreamed of. We weren't very physical. The love making felt obligatory and not passionate like it used to. After the honeymoon we reusmed normal life. Eventually we moved to Oregon for my new job. It paid better and we were more likely to afford a house. We had another kid first try. We didn't put much plan to it. Just said we are married and it would be neat to have a kid. When we did it was a sweet birth. I tried my best to be there for her. I enjoyed the baby but never felt overjoyed about having more kids. I kept focused on work. We traveled all over Oregon and had a great time for 3 years. We ultimately couldn't afford a house again so we decided to move to Wisconsin for a new job and to buy a house and raise our kids. Turns out she didn't want to leave family but wanted to support me. She didn't need a house but thought it was what I wanted so went with it. She wanted to go to California with her family but never told me. After 2 years of working during COVID we felt the strain of our relationship. It felt like we kept drifting apart. I kept trying to prove myself in my job and seek validation and wouldn't give her the focus and presence and attention she so badly wanted. I would come home late so I could stay out with my boss or coworkers and she would get upset. I didn't want to ask her for permission because I wanted to socialize and wanted to work. She wanted me to feel prioritized about everything else. She wasn't even though I kept thinking I was. I kept telling her how much I was doing for her, sacrificing for her, and mad she was never more effusive or grateful. We got in more and more arguments and kept feeling like there was no common purpose or goals that brought us together. We kept identifying that we had different love languages. We didn't feel connected and couldn't figure out why. She wanted my focus to be the only one in the world and didnt want to compete with my work. I wanted her to love me with my work and tell me i was the only one in the world she loved. We couldn't do this for each other. She got really depressed and even suicidal which scared me again to no end. Realizing that if something didn't change it was bad. So I started to disassociate, pull away, separate myself because I wanted her to break up with me. It felt like the only way for her to feel fulfilled and able to live the life the brought out her full self. It felt like the only way for me to live the life that brought out my full self. We started talking about separation. But we kept coming back to each other. Kept coexisting. kept having a physical relationship. And have been cycling there for 6 months slowly pulling away and coming together. Now we are committed to seperating but still sleep together, make love, share a house, have our pictures of our past up. And now it feels so painful and sad and scary to leave. It feels so hard to leave because I keep feeling it could work if I could change and she could change. The more space we have the better our relationship feels. But that feels like nothing really brings us together other than physical connection and friendship.   have I been holding on because I've been too scared to let go of control? If we break up she could once again leave. She could move away. She could take my kids. She could meet another man that would be in my kids lives and my kids would like him more than me. She would love him more than me. I keep caretaking for her needs, doing all the family chores, maintaining co-support, staying physically connected, and holding onto the relationship. What if this is actually what marriage is and somehow I don't understand and want too much much.  What if I am gaslighting myself and bypassing the real incompatibility, but won't let go because I'm scared of what will happen by actually divorcing and separating? I'm struggling so much. Feeling fear. Feeling anxiety. Also feeling so much love for her questioning why I'm even leaving. When I've been together ive questioned why I'm staying. It's really really hard.
