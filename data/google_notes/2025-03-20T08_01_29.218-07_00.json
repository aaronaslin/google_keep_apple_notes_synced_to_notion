{"color":"DEFAULT","isTrashed":false,"isPinned":false,"isArchived":true,"textContent":"You made an ask of me: to share with you if anything changes with me. I promised you I would. This is me fulfilling that promise. \n\nAt 11:45 pm last night, my heart broke open. 37 years, 4 months 17 hours and 45 minutes after I was born. I cried and sobbed the unshed tears from the last 25 years of my life. I cried poo than I ever have before. And in that experience I felt my heart breaking open. The scared young boy that needed to cry but instead buried those tears to put on a strong face, finally cried for those fears and hurts from the past. I felt him release. I felt my release. After the pain subsided I felt calm, clear, and tingling.\n\nWhat became clear, like a stroke of lightning: the most important purpose in my life that I wont regret and cannot trade off for anything, is building deep meaningful relationships with myself, family, friends, community and all life. Relationships built on love.\n\nWithout meaningful relationships, any other achievement would be meaningless at the end of my life. I have gotten purpose backwards. I was so convinced that achievement was how I became worthy of love but it is love that brings me purpose. I know I am worthy of love, regardless of my achievements. I know relationships aren't built on achievements they are built on focus, attention and love. And I now know to live a fulfilled life, relationships come first. \n\nWith this priority clear, I know everything else will fall into place. The right work will be done. And it will be done the right way. It will be done from a place of abundant grounded love in myself, and those I work with. Without this clarity, being confused about my purpose, I have created harm repeatedly. Not knowing what I truly want has harmed me and everyone I care about, including you, repeatedly. Perpetuating harm due to my own lack of clarity, courage and conviction stops today.  Harm will still happen, but it wont come from me not being clear anymore, or courageous enough to live into my convictions.\n\nWhat this means going forward is yet to shake out. Reorienting life towards my purpose first and everything else second will cause major ripples in so many things. Our personal relationship has been and will continue to be impacted. Our work will be impacted. Many things will be impacted. The impacts will need to be worked through as they come, and together with the people impacted.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on rebuilding my family, my relationship with Gil, my kids, my parents, my sisters. My intention is to rebuild my marriage. I don't yet know what this looks like, but this is changing from my intention to separate. I know this will take time and energy, but I know it's where I need to focus. \n\nSecond, I need your help to rebuild our relationship with our work purpose at the center. This feels like a steep hill to climb right now. But it doesn't feel like an impossible hill. I have harmed you deeply in not being clear in my convictions and I know I am responsible for this. And I am prepared to be held to account for the hurt I have caused and am causing you. And, I know this lifequake means we have the potential to be more clear, equipped, and able to acheive our work purpose without my oscillations, personal trauma, and personal healing journey getting in the way. Yesterday was proof of what's possible when purpose is at the center. We know each other very very well. It will either be what breaks us or makes us. \n\nThere is more to say than I could possibly put down right now so I will close with where we started: \"I tell you this to break your heart by which I mean only that it break open and never close again to the rest of the world\"\nYou shared this with me at the very beginning as an intention for us coming together. This is not how I ever thought this would go when my heart finally broke open. But from this place something new will be born. I am and will forever be eternally grateful for your love. \n\n///\n\n\nI recognize that this may be difficult for you to receive. I understand if it brings up feelings of hurt, confusion, disappointment, and I want you to know I honor and respect whatever emotions come up for you.\n\nI wouldn't have arrived at this clarity without your presence, care, and the way you've challenged me to be honest with myself and with you. You have helped me become a better person, and I am deeply grateful for that.\n\nI want to give you the space to process this and share your thoughts, hopes, or concerns. I also hope we can have an open conversation about how our relationship and work can evolve from this place of clarity and mutual respect in right timing.\n\n","title":"","userEditedTimestampUsec":1742482615313000,"createdTimestampUsec":1738862411572000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">You made an ask of me: to share with you if anything changes with me.
