This line of thought has been so pervasive that it's distorted reality, causing me to not acknowledge what's actually happening, and instead double down on trying to fix. Why have I been so focused on one path? Because our Marriage vow is to stick it out through thick and thin, better or worse. I don't want to believe that what might be better for me, and better for Gil, is separation. Yet, I can't deny that when I put the reasons down on paper for the first time, reasons for staying are all based on fear and the reasons for seperating are all based on hope. To hope is to love. To love is to let go, release control and be open to what emerges, even when it breaks my heart open. In breaking my heart open, may it remain open and radiate all the abundant love, compassion, empathy, patience, and joy it can into the world, creating the strength I need to love myself and love Gil in the way we both need.\n\n\nLove is the answer \nWe took a vow to love each other for the rest of our lives. To support each other through thick and thin, good times and bad. Instead of clinging to what is, reality is saying loving each other is creating the space needed to separate our entangles root balls, add more nutrients to the soil, and grow more resilient and strong so we can stand on our own two feet. Love looks like supporting each other in this way, with compassion, patience, gratitude, and hope that we will find a life that lights us up and created peace and joy. Because only then will we have truly lived into the vows to love each other, in the ways we need to be loved.
