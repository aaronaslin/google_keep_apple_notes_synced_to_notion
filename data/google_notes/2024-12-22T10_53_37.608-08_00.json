Its beautiful. Your light is bright with the freedom of being responsible for yourself, and no one else. Able to do what you want and be who you want without anxiety or fear. And I see how your light dims in our relationship, time and time again. Dims out of fear of disappointing, not being good enough, or not being enough. And that dimmed light pulls away. Hears what it wants to hear. And believes what it wants to believe. That you're not good enough. Its becoming too painful for me to continue. I fall into the trap over and over of wanting to help. Of wishing you could see how bright your light is. But instead of mirroring that in you, amplifying your strengths and feeling stronger together, I feel the opposite. That when we aren't together you are the strongest and when we are together you're my kryptonite and I'm yours. \n\nWhen I stop and really listen, I feel the disconnect. I feel like we are in the same universe but orbiting different stars. And I wish more than anything you saw me in my light and were filled with love and excitement, passion and power. That you felt grateful and appreciative of me. But instead I feel the opposite. And I don't want to feel that way anymore. I want to feel see and understood, appreciated and loved. Cherished and adored. And in feeling this way towards me you would feel this exact way reciprocation back from me. But when I love you with all of me I don't feel this radiating back. I feel anxiety and fear and pressure and expectation. We have come to deeply understand how we are different, and that we are very different. And in this exploration I've started to lose what brings us together. How we bring out the best in each other and fill each other up. How every interaction strengthens us, even our fights. How every day we turn towards each other because we want to, and need to. And so I feel like I have given you everything I have to give. I've sacrificed everything I have for you. And in doing so I feel depeleted. I don't feel fuller or more connected or more loved. And that feels like clarity I need to know my energy is best spent creating a relationship around where we are the strongest, not the weakest. And that feels like creating a relationship as separate but respectful and appreciative co-parents of our children, building our own lives in the directions that most naturally fill us up. Removing the pressure to compromise and sacrifice. And instead, direct or energy and love to building a relationship with ourselves, our children and future partners. \n\nWith love,\n\nAaron ","title":"","userEditedTimestampUsec":1734893604275000,"createdTimestampUsec":1733020078588000,"textContentHtml":"<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Dear Gil,<\/span><\/p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0.0pt;margin-bottom:0.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:7.2pt;font-family:'Google Sans';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I see how you light up, take charge and step into your own power.
